## 💭 How it works <a name = "working"></a>

- Worked with Team Lead, Web Developers via Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) to complete the project within the 4week deadline.
- Mainly responsible for implementing front-end design and function realization.
- Applied HTML5 for the structure creation and Material UI for CSS design.
- Followed principles of single responsibility and reusability,  employed React to decompose the UI into a component hierarchy.
- Used the state management tool Redux together with React to centralize state. Also, enabled some useful features like time-travel debugging to rewind and inspect program state.
- Assisted with building the back-end server and the connection to the database, using Node.js and MongoDB.
- Based on HTTP, implemented RESTful API design for handling client requests and server responses.
- Validated user identity by adding JWT token based authentication into the SPA, encoding a token during the process of client and server communication.
